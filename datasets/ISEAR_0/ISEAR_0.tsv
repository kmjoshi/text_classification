the picnic.  When I had the time to think about it I thought that á
my decision was wrong.  My classmates thought that I would go as á
I had signed my name but I did not go.  I told another class á

me why I had not gone to the picnic and everytime someone á
mentioned it I was apologetic.  I should have decided right in á
the begining that I would not go and then they would not see me á
as irresponsible i.e promising to go and changing my mind á
afterwards."	1
